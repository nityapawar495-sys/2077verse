            <h1>ABOUT NEON VEIL</h1>
            <p>
                Step into the neon-lit streets of a dystopian future where shadows hold secrets 
                and light reveals truths. Neon Veil is an immersive cyberpunk adventure that 
                challenges you to navigate a world ruled by corporations, corruption, and conspiracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a city where technology has advanced beyond imagination but humanity has lost 
                its way, you must uncover the truth hidden beneath layers of deception. Every 
                choice matters, every shadow conceals danger, and every light guides your path 
                through the darkness.

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                Neon Veil has been in development for [X years/months], crafted with passion by 
                a dedicated team of developers, artists, and storytellers who share a love for 
                cyberpunk narratives and immersive gaming experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to create not just a game, but an experience that stays with you long 
                after you've put down the controller. Every pixel, every line of dialogue, and 
                every musical note has been carefully designed to draw you deeper into this 
                neon-soaked world.
