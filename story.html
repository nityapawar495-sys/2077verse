            <h1>THE STORY</h1>
            <p class="intro">
                They say the city never forgets. Every scream, every whisper, every secret—absorbed 
                into its neon veins and concrete bones. You were nobody. A ghost in the machine. 
                Until the night you remembered who you were supposed to forget.
            </p>

            <h2>Welcome to Paradise Lost</h2>
            <p>
                Neo-Shanghai, 2087. The jewel of the Asian Pacific. Where dreams are manufactured 
                in corporate towers that scrape heaven, and nightmares breed in the flooded 
                undercity where sunlight is a myth. Fifteen mega-corporations own everything—your 
                job, your home, your data, your DNA. They call it "The New Eden." The streets 
                call it something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fifty million souls crammed into 500 square miles of vertical chaos. The upper 
                districts shine like broken stars—all chrome and holographic promises. Down below, 
                in the Sublevels, people live three to a coffin apartment, breathing recycled air 
                and eating synthetic protein. But everyone has a screen, everyone has the Feed, 
                and everyone is smiling. Because the city makes you smile. Whether you want to or not.
            </p>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>The Ghost in Your Head</h2>
            <p>
                Three months ago, you woke up in a clinic you don't remember entering, with a 
                name you don't recognize and memories that feel like someone else's dreams. The 
                doctors said it was "neural trauma." Standard procedure for a failed suicide 
                attempt. You didn't believe them. You still don't.
            </p>
            <p>
                The nightmares started immediately. Faces you've never seen. Places that shouldn't 
                exist. And a phrase, whispered in a voice that might be your own: "Project 
                Neon Veil." Every time you try to search for it online, your neural implant 
                glitches. Every person you ask suddenly can't remember the conversation. And 
                yesterday, you found something that proves you're not crazy—a data chip hidden 
                in the lining of a jacket you've never worn before. A jacket with your DNA all over it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>The Message From Tomorrow</h2>
            <p>
                The chip contained one file. A video. Of you. But not you—this version is older, 
                scarred, wearing clothes that don't exist yet. And they're terrified.
            </p>
            <p>
                "If you're watching this, they failed to wipe you completely. Good. Listen 
                carefully—you were Dr. Alex Chen, lead architect of the Neon Veil protocol. You 
                designed the system that controls this entire city. Every billboard, every screen, 
                every neural implant—they all broadcast a subliminal frequency that rewrites 
                human perception. The corporations don't just sell products. They sell reality 
                itself. And you helped them do it."
            </p>
            <p>
                The video glitches. When it returns, the other you is bleeding. "They're coming. 
                You have 72 hours before the new protocol launches—Neon Veil 2.0. This time, 
                they won't just control what people see. They'll control what people think they 
                want. Free will becomes a memory. Unless you stop it. The access codes are in 
                your hippocampus. They couldn't erase them without killing you. Find the 
                Architect's Collective. Find Cipher. Trust no one who—"
            </p>
            <p>
                The video ends. Your apartment's AI assistant cheerfully announces you have a 
                visitor. But you didn't buzz anyone in. And your door is already opening.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>Run or Remember</h2>
            <p>
                They call themselves the Architect's Collective—hackers, activists, broken AIs, 
                and corporate defectors who remember what freedom tasted like before it became a 
                subscription service. They found you before the corpo-sec did. Barely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their leader, Cipher, is a ghost—literally. An uploaded consciousness bouncing 
                between bodies-for-hire, staying one step ahead of deletion. She claims you 
                contacted her six months ago, gave her half of a kill-code that could shut down 
                the Neon Veil. The other half is locked in your rebuilt mind, behind walls you 
                built yourself. Walls that are starting to crack.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the deeper you dig, the less certain you become. Were you a hero trying to 
                stop a conspiracy? Or the monster who created it? The corporations are hunting 
                you. The resistance doesn't fully trust you. And every recovered memory makes you 
                question whether the person you're becoming is someone you want to be.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>The Choice That Changes Everything</h2>
            <p>
                48 hours remain. You've infiltrated Helios Corporation's quantum server farm—the 
                heart of the Neon Veil. The kill-code is ready. One upload, and the system dies. 
                Fifteen million people will suddenly see the world as it really is: polluted, 
                broken, dying. The careful illusion of prosperity will shatter. Chaos. Riots. 
                Maybe revolution. Definitely blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                But then you access the full project files. And you understand. The world outside 
                Neo-Shanghai is worse than anyone knows. Climate collapse. Resource wars. Billions 
                dead. The Neon Veil wasn't built to control people. It was built to keep them from 
                giving up entirely. To give them hope, even if that hope is synthetic. Even if 
                it's a lie.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cipher stands beside you, finger on the trigger. "Some lies are worse than death," 
                she says. But another voice echoes in your fragmenting memory—your own voice, from 
                before the wipe: "Some truths are worse than lies."
            </p>
            <p class="tagline">

            <p>
                Every ending is a choice. Every choice is a sacrifice. In Neo-Shanghai, the 
                neon lights don't just illuminate the darkness—they create it. And somewhere in 
                that manufactured shadow, you'll discover whether you're the hero, the villain, 
                or something humanity hasn't invented a word for yet.
